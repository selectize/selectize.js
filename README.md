Selectize is an extensible [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)-based custom `<select>`; UI control. It's useful for tagging, contact lists, country selectors, and so on. The goal is to provide a solid & usable experience with a clean and powerful API.

- [Demos](https://selectize.dev/docs/demos)
- [Changelog](https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js/releases)
- [Documentation](https://selectize.dev/docs/api)

## Features

- **Smart Option Searching / Ranking**
  Options are efficiently scored and sorted on-the-fly (using [sifter](https://github.com/brianreavis/sifter.js)). Want to search for an item's title _and_ description? No problem.
- **Caret between items**
  Order matters sometimes. Use the <kbd>&larr;</kbd> and <kbd>&rarr;</kbd> arrow keys to move between selected items.
- **Select & delete multiple items at once**
  Hold down <kbd>option</kbd> on Mac or <kbd>ctrl</kbd> on Windows to select more than one item to delete.
- **Díåcritîçs supported**
  Great for international environments.
- **Item creation**
  Allow users to create items on the fly (async saving is supported; the control locks until the callback is fired).
- **Remote data loading**
  For when you have thousands of options and want them provided by the server as the user types.
- **Clean API &amp; code**
  Interface with it and make modifications easily. Pull requests are always welcome!
- **Extensible**
  [Plugin API](docs/plugins.md) for developing custom features (uses [microplugin](https://github.com/brianreavis/microplugin.js)).
- **Touch Support**
  Plays nice with iOS 5+ devices.

### Dependencies

- [jquery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) (1.7 and greater), as [peer dependency](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/npm/peer-dependencies/)
  - **Note:** it is installed automatically in development, or in projects using NPM 1 or 2. When using NPM from version 3 on, just a warning is thrown and the user needs to manually install an explicit version in their own project (e.g. `npm install --save jquery@3.5.1`).

**Optional:**

- [jquery-ui](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui) (required by `drag_drop` plugin)

### Installation

Selectize can be installed via NPM `npm install @selectize/selectize`

#### Installing Manually

All pre-built files needed to use Selectize can be found in the
["dist"](dist/) folder.

If you're looking to get started with minimal fuss, include
`selectize.min.js` (bundles Sifter and Microplugin
dependencies – also available un-minified for debugging, just remove the
`.min` part) and `css/selectize.default.css`.

Selectize is available at [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/selectize.js).

- [**js/**](dist/js)
  - [selectize.js](dist/js/selectize.js) — With dependencies, minus jquery
  - [selectize.min.js](dist/js/selectize.min.js) — With dependencies, minus jquery
- [**scss/**](dist/scss) — Sass source files for customization (Bootstrap 3+ compatible)
- [**less/**](dist/less) — Less source files for customization (Bootstrap 2/3 compatible)
- [**css/**](dist/css)
  - [selectize.css](dist/css/selectize.css) — Core styles
  - [selectize.default.css](dist/css/selectize.default.css) — Default theme (with core styles)
  - [selectize.bootstrap2.css](dist/css/selectize.bootstrap2.css) - Bootstrap 2 theme
  - [selectize.bootstrap3.css](dist/css/selectize.bootstrap3.css) - Bootstrap 3 theme
  - [selectize.bootstrap4.css](dist/css/selectize.bootstrap4.css) - Bootstrap 4 theme
  - [selectize.bootstrap5.css](dist/css/selectize.bootstrap5.css) - Bootstrap 5 theme

### Usage

```js
$("select").selectize(options);
```

The available options are [documented here](https://selectize.dev/docs/api).

### Contributing

When issuing a pull request:

- please **do not include/commit changes in the `dist/` or `lib/` folders** to avoid
  merge conflicts. A good way to include the right files is to use
  `git gui` or `git add` when committing to select the files you want to
  add to your commit.

- please **include tests** with your feature so that we're not tempted to
  break it in the future!

Add an entry to the top of the CHANGELOG, and update the documentation
in `docs/` as needed. (Refactors and documentation changes don't need a
changelog entry.)

Squash your commits together in one or a few complete, logical commits,
with a concise and descriptive message. One commit means one
feature/bugfix/thing that has changed, or a diff bringing the code one
step forward to a better, working state.

Once your commit is nice and clean, and you want to _discard the other
changes_, you can use `git checkout .` (that will erase changes to
tracked files) and `git clean [-i/--interactive]` (to erase untracked
files). **However, be careful with those commands, as their function
is to erase things/changes.**

However, be careful not to add the `dist/` files in your commit, as
Grunt automatically regenerates the files in `dist/` as the source is
changed.

#### Tests

Please ensure all the tests pass:

```sh
npm test # defaults to ChromHeadless
BROWSERS=Firefox npm test
BROWSERS=Firefox,Chrome npm test
BROWSERS=Firefox,Chrome,Safari npm test
```

#### Local environment

To run Selectize locally:

```sh
npm start
```

You can then run the examples at `https://loopback.website:4000/`.
