# API Methods

Selectize controls can be controlled programmatically via the methods described in this section. When initializing the control, the selectize property is added on the original `<select>` / `<input>` elementâ€”this property points to the underlying Selectize instance.

```javascript
// initialize the Selectize control
var $select = $("select").selectize(options);
```

```javascript
// fetch the instance
var selectize = $select[0].selectize;
```
