## v0.15.0 · 14 11 2022

### Breaking changes

- The distribution files no longer include a _standalone_ version. The files in the `dist/js` folder are now standalone by default. If you previously referenced files from the `dist/js/standalone` folder you will need to update your references to `dist/js`.
- We have always included all plugins in the distributions files, but no longer provide a way to exclude them from the build.
- We now build the distribution files using `Gulp` instead of `Grunt`
- the `NPM` package now includes the `dist` folder only. If you previously referenced source files directly you will need to update your references to `dist/js/selectize.js` or `dist/js/selectize.min.js`.
