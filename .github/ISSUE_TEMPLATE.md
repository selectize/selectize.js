Welcome to the Selectize bug tracker. Thank you for taking the time to
make Selectize a better library!

Please keep in mind this repository has an important issue backlog and
that maintainers have limited time to fix issues, triage, and understand
them.

If you've never done so, please read the
[guide to reporting issues](https://github.com/fabienwnklr/selectize.js/wiki/Reporting-issues-guide)
in the Wiki to help us better understand your issue.

Place an `x` in the checklist steps (`[ ]` becomes `[x]`) to demonstrate
you have done/verified all the steps you needed to do.

Thank you for reading this! You can now erase everything up to the
following dashes, and then complete what's after.

ISSUES THAT EITHER:

* IGNORE THE ISSUE GUIDELINES
* ERASE THE FOLLOWING TEMPLATE
* DON'T FOLLOW THE PROPER NUMBERED FORMAT FOR STEPS TO REPRODUCE

COULD BE CLOSED.
